# Social Network Analysis of Twitch-Gamers
Project Summary

Learning, exploring and using the processing framework GraphX to do social network analysis operations and algorithms. 

Operations/algorithm to implement
Pagerank for defined users: dynamic and iterative versions, Compute PageRank scores specifically for defined users using either dynamic updates or iterative convergence methods.
Find the most connected user in the graph based on graph degrees.

Measuring importance/rating of users with PageRank: Assign numerical weights to each user based on their importance within the graph using either iterative or convergence-based approaches.
Degree of separation for a single user: Determine the number of steps required to reach all other users from a given user using Breadth-first search (BFS).
Degree of separation between two defined users: Calculate the number of steps required to traverse from one user to another using BFS
This project aims to solve the shortest path problem using Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the path between two vertices in a graph with the minimum sum of edge weights.
